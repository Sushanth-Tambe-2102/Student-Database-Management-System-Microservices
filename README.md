# Student-Database-Management-System-Microservices

- This project implements a scalable and modular Student Database Management System utilizing microservices architecture.
- **Key Features**
  - API Gateway: Provides a single-entry point for all external interactions with the system, simplifying client-side integration.
  - Service Discovery with Eureka: Enables dynamic discovery of available student data microservices, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
  - **Microservices:**
    - Student Personal Details – Manages student information like name, contact details, address, etc.
    - Student Academic Details – Stores and manages academic data like enrollment information, grades, course history, etc.
    - Student Work/Professional Details – Tracks student work experience, internship details, certifications, etc. (if applicable)
- **Benefits**
  - **Scalability:** Individual microservices can be scaled independently based on specific data demands.
  - **Maintainability:** Modular design facilitates easier development, testing, and deployment of individual services.
  - **Flexibility:** New features can be implemented by adding new microservices without affecting existing functionalities.
  - **High Availability:** Service discovery ensures redundancy and uninterrupted service even if a single service encounters an issue.
- This system offers a robust and adaptable platform for managing student data, fostering efficient record keeping and information retrieval for educational institutions and organizations.
